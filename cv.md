1.5 years ago I decided to radically change the field of activity and moved from education to IT.

During this time, I studied at ИТМО, a little at Yandex Practicum, and independently study courses on the Stepik platform.

I have experience as a content manager (with customer support duties).

Have experience with HTML and CSS.
